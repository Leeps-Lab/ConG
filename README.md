# ConG
Continuous-Time Games for Experimental Economics.

ConG is a suite of programs for running experiments with human subjects who interact strategically in real time.
It uses graphics intensively to create a variety of strategic environments, and allows subjects to continuously
change and adapt their strategies. ConG permits several different ways to specify payoff functions, including
arbitrary symmetric bimatrix games. Innovative strategy selectors give the option to display a wide variety of
information in a compact manner. Finally, ConG has support for running games in both continuous and discrete time,
allowing a direct comparison between the two treatments.
